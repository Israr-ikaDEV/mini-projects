# WanderWise Travel Advisor 🌍

This is a practice project I built as part of my **JavaScript Full Stack Certification**.  
It’s a simple **single-page travel advisor app** that allows users to search for destinations by **keyword** (beach, temple, mountain, city, adventure, or a country name) and view recommended places with images and descriptions.
